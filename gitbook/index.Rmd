# Preface {-}
This book is to support the computational reproducibility of the manuscript - _Elevated plasmsuppl complement components in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy_. We recomment readers to consult the publication for a scientific description. This book only contains the analysis workflow and automatically executable R codes that generate statistics and figures for the manuscript.

This book is built by R markdown, **knitr** [@xie2015], and **bookdown**[@R-bookdown].


## System requirement and software
The figures and tables were rendered on the fly by running the Rmd (hyperlink here) files. 

- R $\geq$ 4.0.3
- The _tidyverse_ project packages
- _BiocStyle_, _Rmarkdown_, _bookdown_, _knitr_, and  _tinytex_ packages

## Overview
- First cohort of FSHD and control plasma samples identifies complement components elevated in FSHD plasma     
- Complement assays in a second cohort confirms elevation of complement components     


## Methods
We applied the analysis to each cohort separately and checked whether the signatures were consistent. 

- t-test: for each cohort, compared FSHDs with controls (horizontal bars); do cohort1 and cohort2 give different signatures?
- Normalization: for each complement, scale the protein levels by z-score or z-like-score (center at control).
- Sample score: average z-score per sample explaining how the sample deviates up or above the center of controls (or sample means if using z-score).
- Partial sample scaore: average z-score of selected complements.
- Compare samples and partial sample scores of FSHDs and controls in each cohort. 
- Compare the trend of sample scores (and partial sample score) of cohort1 and cohort 2. How are they different?
- Based on normalized matrix, perfrom PCA and showe first two principal components and loading variables. 

### Normalization

__z-score-like:__ Let $x_{i, j}$ be the values of the matrix $X$, where $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, I\}$ denotes the sample, $j \in \{1, 2, \dots, J\}$ the complement. For each complement $i$, $\overline{X_C}_j$ denotes the mean of the controls and $SD_j$ the standard deviation of all samples. For each complement $i$ and sample $j$, the normalized score is given by $z_{i, j} = \frac{x_{i, j} - \overline{X_C}_j}{SD_j}$. The standardized z-score gives the number of standard deviation by which the value is above or below the observed sample means. On the other hand, our modified version gives the offset score by which the value is above or below the observed control means.
