This repository is made to support computational reproducivity of our manuscript - _Elevated plasma complement components in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy_, a study investiging complement activation via plasma of FSHD patients. We included our R codes, R-compatital datasets (`*.rda`), plamsa/demographic/genetic profile (excel sheets) and github pages explaining the workflow of our analysis and figure generations. 

Please refers to our _github_ pages for reporducible R codes and detail analysis.
